## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Based on the multiple linear regression model, three of the six variables provided for the model have coefficients indicating they provide a  non-random amount of variance to mpg values in the dataet. These three variables are the intercept itself, vehicle length and ground clearance. 

The slope of the linear model can be considered zero since there is sufficient evidence of a significance level lower than the common 0.05 percent.

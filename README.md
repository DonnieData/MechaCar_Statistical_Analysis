## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Based on the multiple linear regression model, three of the six variables provided for the model have coefficients indicating they provide a non-random amount of variance to mpg values in the dataet. These three variables are the intercept itself(mpg), vehicle length and ground clearance. 

The slope of the linear model should notbe considered zero since there is sufficient evidence of a significance. With a p-value much smaller than the asumed signicance level of 0.05%.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

### Overall T-Test 
p-value of 4.938 sufficient evidence showing PSI accross all manufacturing lots is not statistically differnt from the population mean.

### Manufactuering Lot 1 T-Test 
p-value shows signigincatn evidence that lot 1 is statisitcally similiar to the population mean of 1,500 PSI.

### Manufactuering Lot 2 T-Test 
p-value shows signigincatn evidence that lot 2 is statisitcally similiar to the population mean of 1,500 PSI.

### Manufactuering Lot 3 T-Test 
p-value does not show signigincatn evidence that lot 3 is statisitcally different from te population mean of 1,500 PSI.
